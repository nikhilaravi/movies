### Running the code

Please don't shift around the directories. You can run the code in the various .ipynb as they are and they will read from the data folder.

Milestone1: No data needed. Pulled directly from TMDB.
Milestone2: No data needed. Pulled directly from TMDB and IMDB.
Milestone3: Used train_data_with_sampling.csv, test_data.csv and keywords.csv.
Milestone4: No data needed. Pulled posters directly from our Github repo. Note: The data augmentation code's data is not included, because there are too many posters generated.

This project was created for the AC209b class at Harvard Spring 2017
